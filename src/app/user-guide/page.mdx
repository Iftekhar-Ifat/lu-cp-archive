# Main Heading (H1)

This is a paragraph with **bold text** and _italic text_ and some `inline code` as well. Let's also add a [link to Google](https://www.google.com) to test that component.

<lead>
  This is a lead paragraph that uses the custom typography component. It should
  be larger and have a muted color to draw attention.
</lead>

## Secondary Heading (H2)

Here's a paragraph after the H2. The H2 should have a bottom border and proper spacing.

### Tertiary Heading (H3)

<large>
  This is large text that should be prominent but not as large as headings.
</large>

#### Fourth Level Heading (H4)

Regular paragraph text continues here. Let's also try some <small>small text</small> and some <muted>muted text</muted> to see how they look.

## Lists

### Unordered List

Here's an unordered list:

- First item in the list
- Second item in the list
  - Nested item one
  - Nested item two
- Third item in the list with some longer text that might wrap to multiple lines to test the spacing

### Ordered List

Here's an ordered list:

1. First ordered item
2. Second ordered item
   1. Nested ordered item one
   2. Nested ordered item two
3. Third ordered item

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It should have a left border and be styled distinctly from regular text.

> This is a second paragraph in the blockquote.

## Tables

| Name        | Role      | Department   |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------ |
| John Doe    | Manager   | Engineering  |
| Jane Smith  | Developer | Product      |
| Bob Johnson | Designer  | UX/UI        |
| Alice Brown | Analyst   | Data Science |

This is the end of our MDX component testing document. All components should display correctly with proper spacing and styling.
